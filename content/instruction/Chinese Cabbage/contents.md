### Infomation on the Chinese Cabbage

Pak Choi is a microgreen known by many names. Perhaps more recognizable as Chinese cabbage or bok choy.
Produces flavoursome sprouts that contain vitamins A, B, C and K, along with nutrients such as Calcium, Iron and Potassium. A slightly nutty flavour. Ideal with fish and in sandwiches and salads. Sprouts typically ready after 9-10 days.

### growing instructions

1. Moisten the growing mat.

2. Plant the seeds and distribute them evenly. After laying out the seeds, give them a quick misting of water.

3. These seeds need complete darkness for germination, so place a lid on top and put it in the dark place.

4. Chinese Cabbage germinates in 24-48 hours, so keep an eye on your plants in this time and check on their progress.

5. After germination, you should continue to keep them covered up until they start to shed their hulls and are at least 1inch tall. By letting them stretch a bit, you give yourself some wiggle room when harvesting.

NB! Water well over the next week or so, making sure to inspect your crop for mold or fungus as well as dead patches.

6. After about ten days, your microgreens are ready to be harvested. You can let them grow even longer to the true leaf stage, but that’s up to you. Your yield will increase, but the flavor profile starts to mellow out a bit. Try it out though, you may prefer it!

When harvesting, use a very sharp knife or scissors that slices straight through the stems. Aim for about ½ inch above the growing mat to avoid seed husks. Hold your container at an angle if you can so your greens fall straight into their final container.

7. You shouldn’t need to wash your micros if you harvest correctly and have no issues with mold or fungus. By not washing, you save yourself some precious time and also extend the shelf life of the greens.

8. Make sure they are completely dry when storing them. Place them in a sealed container in the fridge and they should last at least a week – but try to eat them while they’re fresh!​
