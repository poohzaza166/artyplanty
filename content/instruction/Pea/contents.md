### Information of Pea

Pea sprouts are high in fibre and rich in protein plus vitamins B3, B5 and B6. A slightly nutty flavour. Ideal for stir-fries and salads; can be eaten raw, grilled or deep fried. They’re full of vitamins that are anti-inflammatory and boost cardiovascular health. Pea microgreens have also been linked to weight loss, which is largely thanks to their fiber content (fiber is known to keep you full for longer).


### Growing Instructions

1. Soaking
Most microgreen seeds don’t have to be soaked before planting, mainly because they’re so small. Pea seeds, however, are larger to begin with and also must absorb water before they germinate and grow.

* Fill your large bowl with water and dump in the seeds. Leave them in there for at least 6-12 hours and no more than 24. The longer they stay, the more evenly the pea seeds should germinate.

* As the pea seeds soak, they expand to double their size. You’ll probably need to refill the water at least once. In fact, you may even need to move some seed to a separate bowl. Once the seeds are plump with water, drain the bowl and give the seeds a good rinse. 

2. Now, spread the pea seeds evenly across the top of the growing mat. Keep the growing mat and seeds moist by misting it with the spray bottle.

3. These seeds need complete darkness for germination, so place a lid on top and put it in the dark place. When the pea microgreens grow, they’ll collectively push up the cover and about 5 pounds of weight. 

4. In 3-4 days, remove the cover and take a peek. Your pea seeds should have transformed into inch-long pea sprouts. They may be pale in color, but they’ll quickly turn green once they get some light.

5. Mist the pea sprouts and begin to water the growing mat itself. Do this when the tray feels light, which may be every few days or even twice a day.

6. As your sprouts turn into pea microgreens, leave the cover off and put them under the sunlight. It’s best to grow the pea shoots directly beneath the light. This will result in healthy, uniform pea microgreens.

7. Harvesting; Here’s where you’ll get a bit of free reign over the pea microgreens. You can choose to harvest them as microgreens or wait a few more days for the growing plants to grow shoots. Growing pea shoots means letting the first few true leaves and tendrils appear. Of course, you can always harvest a portion of pea microgreens and leave the rest to grow pea shoots.

8. If you decide to harvest pea microgreens, wait until they’re 3-4 inches tall and grow their cotyledons (about 3-5 days after sprouting). Then, use your kitchen scissors to snip off the microgreens just above the top of the growing mat. 

9. To harvest pea shoots, cut off the top portion, but leave behind a couple leaves. These will make it much easier for the pea shoot to regrow.

10. Hold off on washing the pea microgreens until you’re just about to use them. These peas need to be as dry as possible for good storage. For those not being used, place them in an airtight container with a paper towel folded inside. The towel will absorb any excess moisture from the peas. With this method, your pea microgreens should last for at least a week – maybe more!
