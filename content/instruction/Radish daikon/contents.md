### information of Radish daikon

Also known as White Radish, Radish Daikon is a popular subject for sprouting due to its spicy flavour. Sprouts ready to harvest after approximately 6-8 days. For use in soups, sandwiches and as a garnish.
When the seeds are sprouted vertically to produce the first set of leaves, they are referred to as kaiware daikon (カイワレ大根). The term "kaiware", which means "open shell", describes the shape of the leaves which have a heart-like shell appearance.



### growing instructions

1. Moisten the growing mat.

2. Plant the seeds. Daikon radish seeds are somewhat small in size, so you can fit about 10 seeds per square inch of growing mat. Granted, you don’t have to count them out one by one, but the radish microgreen seeds should be spread evenly. After laying out the seeds, give them a quick misting of water.

3. These seeds need complete darkness for germination, so place a lid on top and put it in the dark place.

4. Leave the seeds in the dark for 2-3 days until germination is complete. When the radish microgreens start to grow into sprouts, they’ll push up the lid, which is your cue to move on to the next step.

5. Remove the cover tray to check on your seeds. If the majority are now sprouts, keep the cover off and put the seeds under the sunlight.In just a few days, the small sprouts will grow into spindly, white or red stems with a set of lobed cotyledons on top.

6. After they’ve sprouted, always water your radish microgreens from the bottom of the mat. This will keep the plants dry and prevent soil bacteria growth and damping off. Every few days, make sure to feel the weight of the tray to decide if the microgreens need to be watered again. You likely won’t need to water more than 2 or 3 days during the whole process.

7. Within a few more days, each radish microgreen should be 2-3 inches tall. Now’s the ideal time to harvest – just before the true green leaves grow in. Use your kitchen scissors to snip the radish microgreens just above the top of the growing mat. 
NB! These microgreens will get the white root hairs, which are commonly mistaken for mold. These root hairs are normal and part of the growth process.

8. If you only need to use a small amount of microgreens at the time, wait to harvest the rest as needed. Be sure to collect them all before too long though, or the flavor may change. Of course, you can always harvest all in 1 day and just prepare them for proper storage.

9. In case you want to store them, keep them as dry as possible in a cool place such as a fridge. Remember that you only can store them for 1-2 weeks.
