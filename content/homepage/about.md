* What are Microgreens? 

These are vegetable greens harvested right after the first leaves have developed. 

Exactly at this point sprouts contain the most nutritional and energy benefits in the minimum size. Before, a similar amount of nutritional value could only have been accessed from big vegetables, vitamins or nutrition supplements, but this is no longer a requirement with our Microgreens kit.
